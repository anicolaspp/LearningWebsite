1. In order to run the website locally, we need Visual C# 6 included in Microsoft Visual Studio 2015. You could download VS2015 
	from https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx

2. We need at least a MSSQL instance running locally. By default, VS2015 comes with MSSQL Express (the one used at the time of the development). 
3. Open the Visual Studio Solution file by double clicking on the "LearningWebsite.sln" file. 
4. Make sure to point Entity Framework configuration to the right DataBase
	4.1. Open the folder LearningWebsite on the root.
	4.2. Open the "Web.config" file.
	4.3. Find the connectionString XML seccion.
	4.4. The connection string Data Source should point to the local instance, change this to point to you SQL instance if required.
5. Build the solution in Visual Studio and the run it. The web application should run and open by itself a web browser instance. 

Deployments:

The website has been deployed on Microsoft Azure cloud and can be found at http://learningwebsite2.azurewebsites.net.

In order to deploy it to Azure or any other cloud provider, you need to set up your own cloud credentials.
